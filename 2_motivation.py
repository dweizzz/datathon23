st.write('Immunization rates are an important indicator of the health of a country because they directly affect the incidence and spread of infectious diseases. When a large portion of the population is immunized against a particular disease, it becomes much harder for that disease to spread, as there are fewer people who can become infected and serve as a vector for transmission.')

st.header("What should we achieve towards?")
st.write("For many infectious diseases, the threshold for herd immunity is estimated to be around 80-95% immunization coverage, depending on factors such as the infectiousness of the disease and the population density of the area. However, for some diseases, such as measles, the threshold for herd immunity can be higher, around 95-98%, due to their high infectiousness.")
st.write("Generally, the goal for a country's immunization rate should be to achieve herd immunity, which is the point at which enough individuals in a population are immunized against a particular disease that the disease can no longer spread easily.")
st.write("Therefore, a country's goal immunization rate should aim to achieve herd immunity for the diseases that pose the most significant health risks to its population. It is also important for countries to continually monitor their immunization rates and adjust their goals as needed to ensure that they maintain high levels of immunization coverage and prevent outbreaks of infectious diseases.")
